# week-6-Weather-Dashboard-
A weather dashboard that will run in the browser, feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

This application allows you to type in a city name and see the the current temperature, humidity, uv index and windspeed as well as for the next 5 days. It will also keep a record of the most recent city searches as buttons. 
The user may click on those buttons to get the current and 5 day weather forecast for each of those citys.

I want to revist this and change a few things but that is purely from an aesthetic point- everything works! ( although i want to re-vist the code to make it more succinct ) 

I have learned a lot about API's and mybe the biggest lesson is that you can't alway assume they work!
